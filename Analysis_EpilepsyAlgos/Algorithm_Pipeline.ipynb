    "Epilepsy is known as an enduring condition where seizures occur spontaneously\n",
    "without a triggering factor. Refractory epilepsy occurs when antiepilepsy\n",
    "medication no longer diminish the occurrence of seizures. Through\n",
    "the advancements in neurotechnology and biomarker identification, the detection\n",
    "and prediction of epileptic seizures will soon be a reality. Detecting\n",
    "seizures at their onset and predicting their occurrence will be a major breakthrough,\n",
    "and particular beneficial for the quality of like of people with refractory\n",
    "epilepsy, by improving the patientsâ€™ safety, independence, and treatment.\n",

    "Assuming you have an input signal (in this case,\n",
    "EEG) and a label associating it (in this case, Epileptic vs Non-Epileptic), you can train an ML classifier to classify the neural information into one of the labels. Thus,\n",
    "when new, unlabeled information is presented, the model can predict which label\n",
    "the neural information most likely belongs to.\n",

    "Additionally, Bashar et al. were able to reach an accuracy of 0.792 (where 1.00\n",
